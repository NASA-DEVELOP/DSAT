			<h3>NASA DEVELOP Program</h3>
			<p> NASA DEVELOP is a capacity building program within NASA's Applied Sciences. DEVELOP addresses environmental and public policy issues through interdisciplinary research projects that apply the lens of NASA Earth Observations to community conerns. The NASA DEVELOP Climate team at the Ames Research Center created this tool during the summer of 2015. This tool was created by Cheryl Cary, Michael Gao, Vickie Ly, Anton Surunis, and Sophia Turnbull-Appell. </p>

			<h3>Tools</h3>
			<p> The Drought Severity Assessment Tool (DSAT) is a decision support tool created for the Navajo Nation to allow water managers to generate SPI values specific to chosen boundaries within the Nation. DSAT calculates 1-, 6-, or 12- month SPI values cell by cell from monthly precipitation rasters outputting SPI rasters of the area. These SPI rasters can then be processed using the tool, to output zonal statistics based on user-specified boundary layers, and be visualized over a web map. </p>
